Mick Pitzer's Code Louisville Project

This project is designed to be used as a resource for the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution's Library. It is a simple responsive html/css/js site. I usually create pages in WordPress so building manually has been much more difficult that I am accustomed to. In the interest of transparency, I used code snippets for the responsive hamburger menu after failing miserably at trying to code it myself. Hopefully, that doesnt fail me as I have worked hard to create a useful project that will be put to use for our Library Patrons.

The features are as follow:

Responsive hamburger menu
Inclusion of a custom Google font
A responsive table to hold my links
A responsive header
Hypertext links that are not underlined
Contact Form that emails form contents
Responsive header text
Media Query #1 - max screen size 1360px
Media Query #1 - screen max size 768px

First Commit was basic code to begin the site.
Second Commit added favicons, stylesheet called in, google font called in, table was added and hyperlinks were styled.
Third Commit added header, footer, navigation and script called in for the nav bar.
Fourth Commit added a form for my support page.
Fifth Commit added a background image to each page and called in a responsive stylesheet.
